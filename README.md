The index has a propoganda partial which serves as a place for announcements, and banner images.

To configure the text, the image source and the image alt text, use the code injection configuration option in the admin panel to assign the variables `propogandaText`, `propogandaImgSrc`, and `propogandaImgAlt` the appropriate information.
